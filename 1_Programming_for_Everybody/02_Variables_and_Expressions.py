# 2.1 Expressions Part 1

# Constants

    # "Fixed values" such as Numbers, Letters and Strings are called "constants"
    # because their values does not change

    # Numeric Constants
    print(123)
    print(98.6)

    # String Constants
    print("Hello World")
    print('Hello World')

# Reserved Words

    # cannot be used as variable names/identifiers

    False   class   return  is      finally
    None    if      for     lambda  continue
    True    def     from    while   nonlocal
    and     del     global  not     with
    as      elif    try     or      yield
    assert  else    import  pass

# Variables

    # Is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later
    # retrieve the data using the Variable "name"

    # Programmers get to choose the names of the Variables

    # You can change the contents of a Variable in a later statement

    x = 12.2
    y = 14

    x = 100

    # Variable Name Rules:

        # Must start with a letter or underscore _

        # Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscore

        # Case Sensitive

            # Good:
            spam    eggs    spam23  _speed

            # Bad:
            23spam  var.12  #sign

            # Different:
            spam    Spam    SPAM

# Sentences or Lines

    x = 2       # Assignment statement
    x = x + 2   # Assignment with Expression
    print(x)    # Print statement

# Assignment Statements

    # We assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement(=)

    # An assignment statement consists of an "expression on the right-hand side"
    # and a Variable to store the result

    x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
